# Shopping Cart Implementation

## Overview
This project now includes a fully functional shopping cart system implemented using Angular components and services.

## Features

### 🛒 Shopping Cart Component (`shop-car`)
- **Cart Toggle**: Click the cart icon in the header to open/close the shopping cart
- **Item Management**: Add, remove, and update quantities of products
- **Real-time Updates**: Cart updates automatically when items are modified
- **Persistent Storage**: Cart data is saved to localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### 🛍️ Cart Service (`cart-service`)
- **State Management**: Uses RxJS BehaviorSubject for reactive updates
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, remove, update, and clear cart items
- **Automatic Calculations**: Subtotal, total, and savings calculations
- **Data Persistence**: Automatically saves to and loads from localStorage

### 🎯 Product Integration
- **Add to Cart**: Each product card has an "Add to Cart" button
- **Quantity Controls**: Increase/decrease quantities in the cart
- **Stock Validation**: Prevents adding out-of-stock items

## How to Use

### 1. Adding Products to Cart
1. Browse the product grid on the demo page
2. Click "Add to Cart" on any product
3. The cart icon in the header will show a badge with the item count

### 2. Managing Your Cart
1. Click the cart icon in the header to open the shopping cart panel
2. Use the +/- buttons to adjust quantities
3. Click the X button to remove items
4. Use "Clear Cart" to remove all items
5. Click "Proceed to Checkout" when ready (placeholder functionality)

### 3. Cart Features
- **Real-time Updates**: See totals update as you modify quantities
- **Savings Display**: Shows how much you save on sale items
- **Responsive Layout**: Cart adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional slide-in/out animations
